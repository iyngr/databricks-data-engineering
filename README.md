Uncover Insights from NYC Taxi Data with Data Engineering and Databricks

Data Engineering with Databricks
================================

Welcome to the Data Engineering with Databricks repository! In this project, we explore sample NYC Taxi data using Databricks. Our example Jupyter notebook demonstrates data manipulation, visualization, and insights derived from the NYC taxi dataset.

Introduction
------------

Databricks is a powerful platform for big data analytics and machine learning. In this repository, we focus on data engineering tasks using Databricks, specifically analyzing NYC Taxi data. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data engineer, this project provides valuable insights and practical examples.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  **Set Up Databricks**: If you haven't already, create a Databricks workspace and set up your environment.
3.  **Load NYC Taxi Data**: Use the provided Jupyter notebook to load the NYC Taxi data available in Databricks. The dataset is located at `dbfs:/databricks-datasets/nyctaxi/tripdata/yellow`.
4.  **Explore the Notebook**: Open the Jupyter notebook (`NYCTaxi_Analysis.ipynb`) and explore the code. We extract month and year information from trip timestamps, create additional columns, and analyze the data.
5.  **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells in the notebook to see the results.

Example Jupyter Notebook
------------------------

The main notebook for this project is `NYCTaxi_Analysis.ipynb`. It covers the following steps:

1.  Loading NYC Taxi data.
2.  Extracting month and year information.
3.  Filtering out bad records.
4.  Comparing temporary views with Delta tables.
5.  Performing joins with master data.

Feel free to modify and extend the notebook as needed for your own data engineering tasks.
